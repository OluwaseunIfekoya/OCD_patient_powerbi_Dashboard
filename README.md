This project focused on analyzing the characteristics and treatment patterns of patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) using Power BI. The dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of the patient demographics, types of obsessions, compulsions, and associated treatment methods.

1. Patient Demographics and History

Total Patients Analyzed: The dataset comprised 1,393 patients diagnosed with OCD.

Gender Distribution: The gender split was nearly even, with 50.2% (753) Male and 49.8% (747) Female patients.

Marital Status: A slight majority of patients were single (34.07%), while divorced patients accounted for 32.13%, and 33.88% were married.

Family History of OCD: More than half of the patients (50.67%) reported having a family history of OCD, suggesting a significant genetic component in the condition.

2. Patient Age Distribution

Age Group Distribution: The majority of OCD patients fell within the 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70 age groups, with each group having a relatively high representation. The youngest group (18-24) and the oldest group (70 and above) had fewer patients, indicating that OCD is more commonly diagnosed in indivivuals between the age of 30 and 70.

3. Obsession and Compulsion Types

Types of Obsessions: The data revealed a diverse range of obsession types among patients:
Harm-related obsessions were the most common, followed closely by Contamination, Religious, Symmetry, and Hoarding obsessions.

Compulsion Types and Severity:
Counting, Ordering, and Praying compulsions had the highest average scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), indicating greater severity compared to Checking and Washing compulsions.

4. Treatment Patterns
   
Medications by Obsession Type:
Benzodiazepines, SNRI, and SSRIs were commonly prescribed across various obsession types, with SSRIs being the most frequently used medication across all types of obsessions.
Religious and Symmetry related obsessions had a higher percentage of recieving no medication, while Harm-related and Contamination obsessions were more evenly treated with Benzodiazepines and SNRIs.

Total Visits by Medications: Benzodiazepines were the most prescribed medication, accounting for 25.73% of total visits, same as visits where no medications were prescribed (25.73%). SSRI accounted for 23.47% of total visits.

Recommendations

Based on these insights, the following recommendations can be made:

Targeted Treatment Strategies: Given the high prevalence of specific obsession types (e.g., Harm-related, Contamination), personalized treatment plans could be developed to focus on these areas, potentially improving patient outcomes.

Focus on Medication Effectiveness: Considering the widespread use of Benzodiazepines, it may be beneficial to evaluate their effectiveness across different obsession types to ensure optimal dosing and minimize side effects.

Further Investigation into Age Distribution: With the majority of patients falling into the middle-aged category, it could be valuable to investigate why younger and older patients are underrepresented and whether early intervention or more tailored treatments for these age groups could be beneficial.

Family History Consideration in Treatment Plans: Since more than half of the patients reported a family history of OCD, incorporating family history into the treatment planning process could provide more holistic care and potentially lead to better long-term outcomes.
